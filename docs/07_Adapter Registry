# Earth-2 Connector registry

The Earth-2 Weather Analytics Omniverse blueprint is a reference pipeline for building applications for interactive exploration and visualization of terabytes of weather data coming from various data streams. Building solutions that estimate and analyze risk posed by climate and weather are typically informed by many data streams and they vary depending on the use case. 
Blueprint facilitates this by providing an adapter framework for partners in the ecosystem to connect their diverse data streams or solutions. This open registry describes the steps a partner could take to connect to the Earth-2 platform and steps for an application developer to consume these adapters in building their solution. 

## Working with Earth-2 Connector Registry

There are a set of built-in adapters provided with the blueprint that serve as templates. Refer [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse-blueprints/earth2-weather-analytics/blob/main/docs/05_data_federation_mesh.md) for the list of built-in adapters.

### Getting started
Creating a custom adapter requires the following three components:
* Creating the pipeline for DFM to execute - Refer to the reference (source code here)
* Defining the corresponding API Spec in the (API folder)
* Specifying the relevant configuration in the (Config folder)
Please refer to the sequence diagram for (understanding the control flow)
You will need the following to start building your own adapter:
* DFM communicates via XArray format. You need to write your own python based pipeline to convert data from the external source to XArray. Refer to the source code here for (reference)
Here are the steps to create your custom adapter:
* Get (DFM running)
* Using the above components as reference, write your own custom adapter
* The tests in the (test folder) provide an incremental way to check if your code is functional as you develop the specific components.
